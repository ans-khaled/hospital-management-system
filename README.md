# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A complete C++ console-based application to manage doctors, patients, and appointments using strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
Designed for learning and demonstrating clean code structure, terminal UI, and real-world logic simulation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic hospital system where:
- Admins can manage doctors, patients, and appointments.
- Doctors can log in and view their appointments.
- The system supports add/search/list/delete operations with validations and a clean terminal-based UI.

It's built with modern C++ and is perfect to demonstrate your understanding of:
- OOP concepts (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Data structures (vectors, strings, objects)
- Input/output handling and terminal design
